Dear my Elie's owners, We've found a crash that happens intermittently when first installed user selects a purchasing target filter at version 1.1. Already we've fixed it, and waiting for review from apple team. When it happens to you, please just restart an app. If you do, you will be able to purchase normally. New version 1.1.1(hotfix) will release within few days!
