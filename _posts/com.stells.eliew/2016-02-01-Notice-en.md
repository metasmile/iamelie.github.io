Dear my owners, Version 1.2 has been skipped owing to AppStore's problem. Maybe You couldn’t do update from AppStore. And yes, surely, We had been requested confirmation to related apple team. Apple admitted their system problem, but We’re not sure why it’s so. If cause of that discovered, we'll notify it to you guys. Anyway sorry.

 But, you can still enjoy new version of Elie! This version especially has enhanced Live Photos user experiences via all-new developed "continuous 3D Touch". Thanks!
