    <p class="title title-h1">Hello,Testers.</p>
    <p class="title title-h2">I'm Elie.</p>
    <p class="text-block">I'll born in winter days, 2015</p>
  <div class="text-block text-left">
     <p>Click Elie and then keep your face toward the rear camera. When you are almost finished posing, Elie will take a picture of you. Elie is your best smart partner for taking a selfie and it’s an automatic photographing camera without a shutter button.</p>

<p class='subtitle'>It’s time to take a picture with an automatic photographing camera</p>
<p>Elie is just made for you and it can recognize your face. The quality of the rear camera is always much better than the front one so Elie will be your high quality selfie partner. And you could use Elie in different way. For example, when your hands are occupied, just say ‘Elie’ on Siri for asking open it. Or how do you think about putting your phone on drone? You can look forward to the continued update.</p>

<p class='subtitle'> Elie’s room</p>
<p>Do you take a lot of picture for getting a good one? and delete it again and again? ‘Elie’s Room’ is a photo album which is intended to solve this kind of problems.</p>
<p>Now, keep taking a picture with Elie as much as you want. And then share one picture or two, or save it in the iOS album and let the rest.</p>
<p>Elie has a special mechanism to overwrite by circulating a fixed size photo album. So The photo storage capacity will never be increased.</p>
<p>And also, if you activate the Privacy Mode, the photo album will be locked with Touch ID. It can be your own private photo album.</p>

<p class='subtitle'>A variety of functions, but more simple UI</p>
<p>Until when will you look the screen up and down repeatedly? Elie combines and simplifies your moving line when you use it and you can use all the necessary functions with just 3 buttons at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p class='subtitle'>Quick preview</p>
<p>Do you want to view a thumbnail in full size? Click the thumbnail for one second.
You can turn the screen from side to side and if you remove your finger from the screen, it will be undone. How fast and simple it is.</p>

<p class='subtitle'>Veil</p>
<p>When Elie takes a picture of you, the screen faces the outside. You could be embarrassed a little bit but don’t worry. Elie will hide your face or your pictures with some great curtains.</p>

<p class='subtitle'>Elie’s feedback</p>
<p>Elie will give you a signal with the light or the sound just before photographing like someone take a picture of you. If you are so far from the camera that you can’t recognize the signal sound, Elile will give you a signal with the light.</p>

<p class='subtitle'>Control of shooting speed</p>
<p>You can control the shooting timing as you want. If you select ‘Shooting Speed’, you can take a picture one by one and review with the pictures, and you can also take a picture at the fastest tempos in all qualities.</p>

<p>When there is bright sunshine behind your back, use a function ‘Remove of backlight’. Your nice face will not be covered by sunshine any more.</p>

<p>Just slide the photo album. Elie will be inactivated and changed to manual camera mode. You can control some functions such as the manual exposure.</p>

<p class='subtitle'>Quick Camera</p>
<p>When you want to take a picture fast while looking the photo album, keep touching the center button in the bottom. The small preview will get bigger and then, select the front camera or the rear camera moving your finger side to side. If you remove your finger from the screen, it will be photographed.</p>

<p class='subtitle'>Time of Shooting and tilt-shift</p>
<p>Editing after photographing is out of date for now. Click the effect ‘Tilt-Shift’ in control panel. Elie will apply the beautiful effect ‘tilt-Shift’ while photographing.</p>
