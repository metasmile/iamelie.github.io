  the copyright owner that is granting the License.</p>

  <p>“Legal Entity” shall mean the union of the acting entity and all <br>
  other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common <br>
  control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, <br>
  “control” means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the <br>
  direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or <br>
  otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the <br>
  outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.</p>

  <p>“You” (or “Your”) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity <br>
  exercising permissions granted by this License.</p>

  <p>“Source” form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, <br>
  including but not limited to software source code, documentation <br>
  source, and configuration files.</p>

  <p>“Object” form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical <br>
  transformation or translation of a Source form, including but <br>
  not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, <br>
  and conversions to other media types.</p>

  <p>“Work” shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or <br>
  Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a <br>
  copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work <br>
  (an example is provided in the Appendix below).</p>

  <p>“Derivative Works” shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object <br>
  form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the <br>
  editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications <br>
  represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes <br>
  of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain <br>
  separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, <br>
  the Work and Derivative Works thereof.</p>

  <p>“Contribution” shall mean any work of authorship, including <br>
  the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions <br>
  to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally <br>
  submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner <br>
  or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of <br>
  the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, “submitted” <br>
  means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent <br>
  to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to <br>
  communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, <br>
  and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the <br>
  Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but <br>
  excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise <br>
  designated in writing by the copyright owner as “Not a Contribution.”</p>

  <p>“Contributor” shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity <br>
  on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and <br>
  subsequently incorporated within the Work.</p></li>
  <li><p>Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of <br>
  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, <br>
  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable <br>
  copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, <br>
  publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the <br>
  Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p></li>
  <li><p>Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of <br>
  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, <br>
  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable <br>
  (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, <br>
  use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, <br>
  where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable <br>
  by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their <br>
  Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) <br>
  with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You <br>
  institute patent litigation against any entity (including a <br>
  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work <br>
  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct <br>
  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses <br>
  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate <br>
  as of the date such litigation is filed.</p></li>
  <li><p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the <br>
  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without <br>
  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You <br>
  meet the following conditions:</p>

  <p>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or <br>
     Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>

  <p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices <br>
     stating that You changed the files; and</p>

  <p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works <br>
     that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and <br>
     attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, <br>
     excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of <br>
     the Derivative Works; and</p>

  <p>(d) If the Work includes a “NOTICE” text file as part of its <br>
     distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must <br>
     include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained <br>
     within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not <br>
     pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one <br>
     of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed <br>
     as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or <br>
     documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, <br>
     within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and <br>
     wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents <br>
     of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and <br>
     do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution <br>
     notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside <br>
     or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided <br>
     that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed <br>
     as modifying the License.</p>

  <p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and <br>
  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions <br>
  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or <br>
  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, <br>
  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with <br>
  the conditions stated in this License.</p></li>
  <li><p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, <br>
  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work <br>
  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of <br>
  this License, without any additional terms or conditions. <br>
  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify <br>
  the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed <br>
  with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p></li>
  <li><p>Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade <br>
  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, <br>
  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the <br>
  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p></li>
  <li><p>Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or <br>
  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each <br>
  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an “AS IS” BASIS, <br>
  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or <br>
  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions <br>
  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A <br>
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the <br>
  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any <br>
  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p></li>
  <li><p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, <br>
  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, <br>
  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly <br>
  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be <br>
  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, <br>
  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a <br>
  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the <br>
  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, <br>
  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all <br>
  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor <br>
  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p></li>
  <li><p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing <br>
  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, <br>
  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, <br>
  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this <br>
  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only <br>
  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf <br>
  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, <br>
  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability <br>
  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason <br>
  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p></li>
  </ol>
